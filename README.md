Red Arrow Puppet Factory
========================

This is a Puppet based repository for generic automation configurations. The intention is to have various base boxes available for experimentation with different operating systems, and also have a repository of generic configurations for platforms like Postgres, MySQL, Subversion (sadly, I have actually had to setup Subversion servers) and anything else that would serve as a useful reference for things I'm using at work or on personal projects.

I'm going to have a mirror repository that uses Ansible as the configuration management. I'd perfer to use that primarily, but I'm also going to maintain this one, because for the time being, I need to use Puppet at work. In particular, the base boxes will come in handy for that.

Why Red Arrow? It's a place from Vernor Vinge's first novel, 'The Peace War'. It's where the 'tinkers' built their equipment to rebel against 'The Peace Authority'. OK, so it doesn't quite fit with the theme, but I wanted something better than 'generic automation' :).
